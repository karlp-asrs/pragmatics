The Pragmatics of Private Markets Investing

Introduction and Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper discusses quantitative and other methods which may be useful
 in structuring a private markets investing program.
 Private markets approaches have grown dramatically in recent decades with
 multi-trillion dollar markets available through vehicles sponsored by groups
 marketing to the institutional and, increasingly, the high net worth community.
 These investments pose unique challenges for those charged with managing
 them requiring methods specialized for the structure of the investments.
 A selection of these methods is presented here and code for implementing
 them is provided in an accompanying Github site.

While I work for ASRS as CIO, this work and the views it expresses are my
 own.
 The policies of ASRS are set in accordance with its governance policy and
 may be different from what is stated here.
 Any information about ASRS is drawn from public information readily available
 on its website.
 As a matter of style, I use

we
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 rather than

As it was building its private markets investing program, ASRS found a dearth
 of tools for performance measurement and cost analysis.
 While commercially available tools for performance assessment have increased
 markedly in recent years, there is still a need for better tools to understand
 cost.
 This article presents some possible approaches to address these needs.

Strategy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As investors we learn we learn about strategy in the context of strategic
 asset allocation; i.e.
 the proportion of assets allocated to risks and associated premia related
 to equities, rates, credit, real estate and so forth.
 These decisions are the most important determinant of outcomes, at least
 after the fact.
 As important as this is, we are using the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

strategy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a different way.
 We are referring to business strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can think of business strategy is an antonym to luck.
 It answers the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how do we earn the profits we make.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 You earn them because somebody values what you do and you do it well.

The history of private markets institutional investing goes back to the
 1980s and 1990s.
 In those days, mere liquidity was a strategy.
 When the market suffered dislocations, for example in the RTC crisis of
 the early 90s, private capital seized on opportunities that were wildly
 mispriced.
 The RTC saw its mission as rapidly resolving failed S&Ls and they auctioned
 the assets individually and in pools to a market that simply was not structural
ly organized to absorb the volume of assets delivered.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extraordinary returns earned from these times attracted additional capital
 and a private equity and private credit industry has organized itself globally
 with investment capacity measured in trillions of dollars.
 Private capital is now deeply embedded in the structure of capital markets
 and an effective competitor to public markets.
 It used to be that once a company reached a billion or so in enterprise
 value, its only option to raise capital for growth was in public markets.
 Following various crises of the last thirty years, regulation of public
 companies and the increasing presence of activist shareholders has increased
 the cost of going public and the reduced the attractiveness of it.
 In the meantime, the availability of private capital and the competitiveness
 of private markets with multiple firms bidding on deals has made it feasible
 and efficient to finance firms to mid-cap and even large-cap range outside
 public markets.
 This is a self-reinforcing cycle leading to continued growth in private
 capital as investors seek access to these opportunities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this context, liquidity and savvyness about discerning value and opportunity
 are still needed but no longer sufficient.
 The sheer size of private markets ensures competitive bidding for pretty
 much anything that comes to market.
 In order to continue to earn excess returns, the best private capital firms
 have invested in their firms to create ever deeper expertise in the markets
 they address.
 They use this expertise to create strategic advantage to generate or gain
 access to deals and to formulate and execute business strategy for cmpanies
 or properties owned.
