# The pragmatics of private markets investing
This is a repository containing files related to an article that I wrote for the Journal of Portfoliio Management.  The file names "pragmatics jpm.lyx/pdf" present the article as published.

An earlier version of this article is also saved here as "pragmatics.lyx/pdf".  This earlier version is longer and includes code and training materials to demonstrate how to calculate PMEs and other analytical methods described in the article.  Additional information about these methods and other investing topics is found at https://karlp-asrs.github.io/
