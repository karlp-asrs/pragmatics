 Private markets investing is business investing and you need to focus on
 the quality of the business approach in creating strategic advantage in
 the markets served.

2.
 Private markets investing is a hiring decision and you need to assess the
 quality of the organization under consideration for a strategy.
 Management should be expected to demonstrate an ability to not just remain
 healthy, but grow and improve through the tenure of your relationship with
 them.

 Managing cost of fees is important, bot not sufficient to ensure success.
 Alignment of interest across a range of outcomes, not just the upside,
 should be given paramount importance in partnership structuring.

I have worked for the Arizona State Retirement System for the last ten years,
 initially as Head of Private Markets Investing and as CIO for the last
 4 years.
 However, this work and the views it expresses are my own.
 The policies of ASRS are set in accordance with its governance policy and
 may be different from what is stated here.
 Any information about ASRS is drawn from public information readily available
 on its website.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

These views incorporate a framework for investment decision making and underwrit
ing of strategies and firms.
 The process for assessing strategies and firms is unavoidably qualitative
 and subjective.
 However, I also present some analytical methods that I think are useful
 in support of the decision process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Institutional investors have adopted the use of private markets strategies
 in their portfolios at a rapidly increasing rate in recent decades.
 The markets themselves have grown commensurately to multi-trillion size.
 As the number of listed companies has declined, private markets have become
 difficult to ignore.
 This paper does not, however, attempt to justify the decision to invest
 in these markets or develop an approach to incorporating them in a strategic
 asset allocation analytical framework.
 It starts, instead, from a standpoint that those decisions have already
 been made.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When asked to explain the underwriting process for private markets investing,
 I use the metaphor of a three legged stool.
 One leg each for strategy, organization and track record.
 By strategy, I refer to business strategy.
 What market are you addressing; what is your competitive advantage and
 how do you think you will add value? As a critical step in the process,
 we assess the health of the asset management organization.
 Do they have the organizational depth and skills to implement the target
 strategy? Have they created a culture that will allow them to continue
 to grow and improve over the life of the investment? We examine track record
 as confirmatory evidence on the first two questions.
 Track record alone is a weak indicator of likely future success.
 Finally, we consider the terms of an investment partnership as to the appropria
teness of the costs associated with it and the reliability of the alignment
 of interest of the investor and investment manager.

\begin_layout Section*
STRATEGY
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As investors we learn we learn about strategy in the context of strategic
 asset allocation; i.e.
 the proportion of assets allocated to risks and associated premia related
 to equities, rates, credit, real estate and so forth.
 These decisions are the most important determinant of outcomes, at least
 after the fact.
 As important as this is, we are using the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

strategy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a different way.
 We are referring to business strategy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can think of business strategy as the opposite of luck.
 It answers the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how do we earn the profits we make.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 You earn them because somebody values what you do and you do it well.
 Strategy endures.
 Luck doesn't.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The history of private markets institutional investing goes back to the
 1980s and 1990s.
 In those days, mere liquidity was a strategy.
 When the market suffered dislocations, for example in the RTC crisis of
 the early 90s, private capital seized on opportunities that were wildly
 mispriced.
 The RTC saw its mission as rapidly resolving failed S&Ls and they auctioned
 the assets individually and in pools to a market that simply was not organized
 to absorb the volume of assets delivered.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extraordinary returns earned during these times attracted additional
 capital and a private capital industry has organized itself globally with
 trillions of investment capacity.
 Private capital is now deeply embedded in the structure of capital markets
 and an effective competitor to public markets.
 It used to be that once a company reached a billion or so in enterprise
 value, its only option to raise capital for growth was in public markets.
 Following various crises of the last thirty years, regulation of public
 companies and the increasing presence of activist shareholders has increased
 the cost of going public and reduced the attractiveness of it.
 In the meantime, the availability of private capital and the competitiveness
 of private markets with multiple firms bidding on deals has made it feasible
 and efficient to finance firms to mid-cap and even large-cap range outside
 public markets.
 This is a self-reinforcing cycle leading to continued growth in private
 capital as investors seek access to these opportunities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this context, liquidity and savvyness about discerning value and opportunity
 are still needed but no longer sufficient.
 The sheer size of private markets ensures competitive bidding for pretty
 much anything that comes to market.
 In order to continue to earn excess returns, the best private capital firms
 have invested in their firms to create ever deeper expertise in the markets
 they address.
 They use this expertise to create strategic advantage to generate or gain
 access to deals and to formulate and execute business strategy for companies
 or properties owned.
 This trend also drove firms to specialize.
 For all but the very largest firms, there was a need to select which markets
 they want to address in order to build teams to accomplish their objectives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Private equity strategies can broadly be categorized as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

growth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

value
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In growth approaches, your goal is to accelerate the top line while optimizing
 operations to drive down unit costs enhancing profitability or creating
 a path to it.
 In value strategies, you rationalize operations in order to harvest cash
 flow.
 Practically any market offers opportunities to build businesses and make
 money.
 The question for the investor is whether the team you are evaluating is
 well prepared to tackle the issues presented by the strategy they are pursuing.
 In order to add value, the skills required will go well beyond financial
 deal-making skills.
 In private equity, operations teams are critical.
 If you are going to actually achieve 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

synergy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 benefits when combining two firms, you need to support the management teams
 in successfully completing the necessary integration.
 Specialized industry expertise is often essential, whether it's marketing
 and logistics expertise for consumer brands or geologists and engineers
 who can evaluate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

quality of rocks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in oil and gas ventures.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, real estate delivers value to consumers through design.
 Real estate design is the province of architects and urban planners and
 the best firms incorporate them on their team.
 These professionals are experts in consumer preference and craft a strategy
 for building design responsive to location and environmental context that
 creates a strategic advantage in fulfilling its commercial purpose.
 Time and time again, we see well designed and operated buildings maintaining
 high occupancy and earning premium rents in markets and neighborhoods that
 otherwise would be regarded as highly competitive.
 Employment trends, the tastes of millenials and impacts of technology are
 rapidly changing what constitutes good design and risks of obsolescence
 in real estate are high.
 Value strategies of investing in older buildings at discount prices need
 to be evaluated carefully.
 Unlike other investment categories where scale is usually paramount, the
 fundamental attractiveness of real estate as an investment category is
 enhanced by the intensely local nature of markets creating the opportunity
 for competitive advantage and pricing power at relatively small scale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Credit strategies achieve their success through their access to deal pipeline
 and discipline and diligence in deciding whether or not to make a loan.
 Credit firms must have sourcing operation with extensive relationships
 across the industry they serve.
 Lending decision require deep expertise in credit analysis including industry
 coverage teams.
 Once the loan is made, the die is largely cast.
 Nevertheless, active monitoring is extremely important.
 Rapid action in addressing a deteriorating credit can improve recovery
 rates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final test of strategy is consumer-centeredness.
 We started out by saying understanding strategy is similar to a firm grasp
 of the answer to how a firm earns its profits.
 If it's lucky or exploitative, it won't be sustainable.
 Firms have multiple constituencies and as firms mature, they evolve in
 how they embrace their responsibilities.
 For asset management firms, the first order customer is the asset owner
 which has entrusted them with a portion of their capital for management.
 The issues here are pretty straight-forward – the asset owner wants its
 money turned into more money together with some niceties like being kept
 informed on how things are going along the way.
 More to come on this when we discuss terms in a later section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To distinguish themselves, firms must serve a broader customer set.
 Private equity firms serve the management teams of the companies they own.
 A software industry investor adds value if it has an internal consulting
 team with expertise in software development and marketing.
 Such a firm becomes a preferred partner getting a last look in auctions
 or even having the chance to buy businesses 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

off market
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 A middle market credit firm adds value through its reputation for reliably
 closing and fair dealing when conditions evolve for better or worse.
 Such a firm can achieve premium pricing and hold firm on other terms and
 covenants.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, these relationships create access to deal flow.
 A firm must demonstrate an ability to actually deploy capital, timely,
 in the amount raised and consistent with the parameters of the promised
 strategy.
 I am not put off by a firm's aspiration to grow and, realistically, that
 is a goal for any firm of quality.
 However, an asset manager should be prepared to demonstrate that their
 strategy is scalable within the bounds of their fund raising aspirations,
 without drift or deterioration in underwriting standards.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every firm has a critical internal customer set in the people who work there.
 This is the topic of the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
ORGANIZATION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you select strategies to pursue, you need to hire teams to implement
 them.
 Private markets investing concerns itself principally with this hiring
 decision.
 Though we analyze prior investments, it isn't the same as securities analysis.
 When Warren Buffet drinks a Coca Cola and reads their financial statements
 and decides he likes it, he then can buy the stock and Coca Cola is what
 he gets.
 You can analyze the prior track record of a private equity firm all you
 want, but you don't get those deals.
 What you are evaluating is whether they have created a culture and process
 that adds value and assessing whether you think it is likely they will
 repeat that success.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will start evaluating an organization simply by looking at the size
 and composition of the team.
 Is it big enough and does it contain the technical specialties necessary
 to implement the planned strategy.
 A relevant statistic is firm assets under management divided by employee
 headcount.
 From that information, you can calculate an estimate of the recurring revenue
 per employee.
 The revenue should be high enough to support the team allowing for continued
 growth and advancement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firm culture will be critical in the success of the firm and its investments.
 One of the biggest challenges for a private markets investor is dealing
 with situations where a firm deteriorates because of internal conflict,
 shifts in focus or unplanned transitions.
 These situations typically lead to poor investment results and if you can
 screen out firms at risk for these outcomes, you will enhance your investment
 results.
 Founder leadership style establishes and guides the culture.
 In building a firm founders make a series of increasingly selfless decisions.
 The first decision is to found the firm in the first place.
 The founders have a fire in their belly to pursue something reflecting
 their unique take on strategy and build something which is their own.
 This first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

at bat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is critical – if you don't have enough early success to attract capital
 and talent, the firm never really gets off the ground.
 As the firm progresses, the founders are then faced with the task of transition
ing from deal culture to firm culture.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the fun things about being an investor in private markets is the
 opportunity to meet many founders and observe how they manage this journey.
 The best managers de-emphasize the personalities of the founders in order
 to build the culture of the firm.
 Leaders in this style see leadership as service and as an antonym to authority.
 They build a culture reflecting a philosophy and discipline of business
 practice and then trust the culture.
 Decisions and responsibility are increasingly entrusted to the team as
 their skills and experience grow.
 The founders don't hold themselves out as final decision makers.
 Instead they monitor that appropriate discipline was observed in making
 the decision and that feedback loops are present to appropriately measure
 the outcome of the decision and learn from those outcomes.
 Teamwork is emphasized.
 Every individual understands her role and does not let down her colleagues
 with substandard, incomplete or tardy work.
 People learn to trust each other in the integrity and professionalism of
 their work.
 Leadership in this context serves the firm, the employees and the culture.
 The leaders accept financial rewards only after taking care of the team
 first.
 They are quick to credit the team for their work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compensation and employment terms are important.
 This is where the rubber hits the road.
 While it may be the case that employees will be loyal to firms that create
 a rich employment experience full of challenge, team comraderie and joy
 from shared experience of success, this only goes so far and the firm will
 deteriorate if the riches created are not properly shared.
 Persons in authority who accept rewards for themselves without first taking
 care of their teams are creating an intrinsically toxic environment.
 As the firm evolves, it will develop formalized and for more senior personnel
 contractual arrangements for sharing profit.
 Careers are emphasized and career conversations about what this job means
 to each person occur regularly.
 The uniqueness of individuals is a source of strength for the culture.
 Succession planning and ownership of the asset management firm must be
 addressed well in advance of founder retirement both to protect investors
 from adverse consequences of unplanned transitions and to complete the
 bond with the next generation of managers who will succeed the founders.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The capital of an asset management firm is human capital.
 Founders who make the short term sacrifice of building a high quality culture
 that exists beyond them and will endure after them achieve more for themselves
 and the markets they serve than those with a narrower view of self interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assessing these things is difficult.
 In my own case, I use a thought experiment and ask myself if a firm is
 a place I would want my adult children to work.
 Will they be continuously challenged with projects and duties of increasing
 complexity as their skills grow? Will they receive regular candid feedback
 and will they receive financial rewards commensurate with the value of
 their work? Will they advance in a career path suited to them providing
 opportunities for technical excellence or the chance lead a team or a business
 line? Will the culture, however demanding, avoid hazing rituals and allow
 them to grow as individuals with interests and relationships beyond work?
 If it's a workplace where you'd be proud and happy for your children to
 be associated with it, then it has a decent chance of surviving and thriving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
TRACK RECORD
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why do we look at track record? Luck and randomness are everywhere and just
 because a firm has done well, it is far from certain it will continue to
 do so.
 In public markets, there is some evidence that strategies that have recently
 done well will deteriorate.
 In private markets, the evidence for persistence of performance is, at
 best, equivocal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We understand all that, but care about track record anyway.
 We care about it because it is the one unfudgeable and unspinnable piece
 of evidence we have that might help us assess whether the firm has created
 a quality culture and is pursuing a robust strategy.
 Track record is evidence of talent and one hopes that talent will be sustained
 and grow with experience and maturity in the context of a high quality
 firm.
 What follows is an explanation for calculating performance metrics for
 private equity style investments.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Traditional Methods of Performance Measurement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time weighted returns are the standard methodology for evaluating and comparing
 investment performance in liquid markets.
 They are not appropriate for PE investments which are typically in the
 form of limited partnership interests and the financial sponsor has the
 right to control the amount and timing of capital called in to the partnership
 resulting in an ever changing amount of capital deployed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The traditional performance metrics for private equity are TVPI and IRR.
 TVPI is "total value as a percent of invested" and is simply the ratio
 of value received to investment.
 IRR refers, of course to internal rate of return.
 These traditional measures collectively give a good sense of the performance
 of a particular PE investment and allow you to compare private equity investmen
ts to each other.
 Data services tracking private equity use a combination of these metrics
 to rank performance in "quartiles".
 They customarily group funds to control for market context in "vintages"
 based on the year the partnership began investing.
 So, a 2006 vintage fund which invested across the global financial crisis
 and earned a 10% IRR might be a top quartile performer for that vintage,
 while the same IRR might be below average for a 2009 vintage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Public Market Equivalent methods 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Controlling for market context by vintage is useful but still crude because
 there is a lot of variability of patterns of calling and returning capital
 from fund to fund.
 A good method to compare private market IRRs with public markets is what
 is needed.
 Steve Kaplan and Antoinette Schoar formulated a method for calculating
 private equity performance as a "public market equivalent" which we will
 refer to as KSPME 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kaplan2005"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 KSPME is calculated as ratio of benefits to costs and a value greater than
 1 indicates performance above the opportunity cost benchmark.
 The calculation is illustrated in the following formulas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The required data are a time series of capital calls 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$C_t$
\end_layout

\end_inset

, a time series distributions 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$D_t$
\end_layout

\end_inset

, a final value at time 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$n$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$V_n$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and a time series of dividend adjusted market indices 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$M_t$
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 You calculate a future value factor as the ratio of the market index at
 time 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$n$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 divided by the index at prior times 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$t$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$$FV_t=
\backslash
frac{M_n}{M_t}$$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You then multiply (pair-wise for each of the values) the future value factor
 times calls and distributions 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$$C_{FV}=C_t * FV_t$$ ; $$D_{FV} = D_t * FV_t$$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You now have what you need to calculate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$$KSPME = 
\backslash
frac{
\backslash
Sigma D_{FV} + V_n}{
\backslash
Sigma C_{FV}}$$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
KSPME is a wealth measure reflecting how much extra money you have by investing
 in the private equity fund compared to an alternative public markets investment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gredil, Griffiths and Stucke have proposed an additional metric, called
 "Direct Alpha", which converts KSPME to annual rate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Gredil2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 KSPME tells you how much extra money you made and Direct Alpha tells the
 annual rate at which you made it.
 Direct Alpha is calculated as the IRR of a time series constructed by combining
 the future value adjusted calls (as negative numbers), distributions and
 the final value.
 So, it uses exactly the same data as KSPME but with different calculations
 to reduce the data to a single measurement.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$$Direct Alpha = 
\backslash
log{(1+IRR(-C_{FV},D_{FV},V_n))}$$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have an IRR of a private equity investment 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$IRR_{PE}$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 calculated as a discrete annual return, you can then calculate an 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$IRR_M$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 that you would have earned by investing in a market index with the same
 timing of investments and withdrawals as the calls and distributions of
 the private equity investment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$$
\backslash
log{(1+IRR_M)} = 
\backslash
log{(1+IRR_{PE})} - DirectAlpha$$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
KSPME and Direct Alpha supplement the traditional private equity performance
 measurements with methods that allow you to compare the private returns
 to public returns.
 In effect, these methods accurately measure the opportunity cost of public
 market investments foregone with the allocation to private markets.
 PME methods are not a magic bullet, but they are very useful.
 Prior to these methods, it was difficult to benchmark performance.
 PME methods provide a rigorous tool for assessing performance relative
 to market which is an essential starting point for assessing the quality
 of a firm and its strategies.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Consideration of skewness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One last topic on performance assessment deserves mention.
 As is well known, stock market returns are skewed with a few outliers contribut
ing disproportionately to performance.
 Hank Bessembinder has shown that only 4% of stocks have contributed substantial
ly all the outperformance of the stock market since the great depression
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bessembinder2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.We'd like to see a similar positive outlier type of skewness in our private
 markets investments.
 The data sets are too small in private markets for any pretension of fancy
 statistics.
 I prefer something I call a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

slugging percentage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is simply the percentage of deals that have returned 3X or more of
 the initial investment.
 We then compare that to the percentage of deals that have lost money and
 if it's comfortably larger, we have evidence of the sort of skewness we
 are looking for.
 In the next section, we will analyze the effect of incentive compensation
 on the skewness of net returns and you will see that positively gross returns
 are needed to balance things out for the investor.

Private equity structures are complicated and difficult to analyze.
 We present here some approaches to analyze general partner compensation
 in real estate and private equity partnerships.
 Real estate and private equity investments are typically owned in a partnership
 which includes a general partner (the "sponsor") and limited partners ("investo
rs").
 The sponsor organizes the investment, recruits the investors and manages
 the assets.
 The general partner is typically compensated with an asset management fee
 and an incentive fee.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The asset management fee is usually stated as a percent per annum of assets
 under management.
 This can be either as a percent of "commited" capital or "invested" capital.
 In the former case, the fee is earned based on the amount the investors
 commit from the inception of the partnership without regard to when the
 capital is called.
 If the asset management fee is based on invested capital, then the fee
 is calculated only on capital which has been called.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The incentive fee ("carry") is typically stated as a percent of profits.
 Profits are normally defined as the gross profits of the investments after
 returning partnership expenses including the asset management fee.
 Usually, a hurdle rate of return must be achieved before sharing begins.
 So, a typical deal might be stated as "20% carry over an 8% pref with a
 50% catchup".
 This means that the investor has to earn at least an 8% return after fund
 level costs before the sponsor earns any carry.
 Above an 8% return, the sponsor gets half the profit (i.e.
 the catchup is 50%) until the ratio of profit split is 20% to sponsor.
 Thereafter, the profits are split 80% to the investors and 20% to the sponsor.
 Incentive fees of 20% over an 8% hurdle are nearly universal in private
 equity.
 But the catchup is negotiable, with somewhere in the 50% to 100% range
 being typical.

 Figure 2 shows the share going to sponsor and investor in this structure
 with a 2% asset management fee.

Real estate deals have greater variation.
 Many real estate deals have multiple layers, but no catchup.
 So, a real estate deal might be stated as "20 over 8, 30 over 12 and 50
 over 20 with a 2% asset management fee, half of which is deferred until
 after 8%".
 Stated this way, sponsor starts sharing 20% of profits once the investor
 earned an 8% return, switching to 30% of profits once the investor has
 earned a 12% return and 50% of profits once the investor has earned a 20%
 return.
 Only 1% of the asset management fee is paid unconditionally.
 The remainder is paid once the investor has earned 8%.
 Figure 3 shows the fee under this structure and figure 4 shows the marginal
 share of earnings going to the sponsor at various gross returns.

 I think the best way to look at this is by considering fees as a percent

 Let's revisit the real estate example structure and suppose that we consider

\begin_layout Subsection*
Consideration of skewness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Investment results are skewed by these compensation structures.
 Investors own all of the downside but share the upside with the sponsor.
 Suppose we think for a particular investment gross returns are normally
 distributed, with a mean of 15% and standard deviation of 15%.
 How are the net returns distributed? Figure 6 shows the skewness of net
 returns using the multi-tier real estate structure described previously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Negotiating terms to manage cost
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary fee cost drivers in private equity type investment are the asset
 management and incentive fees.
 If you are trying to negotiate and reduce cost, here are some suggestions
 on where to direct your focus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pay close attention to the catch-up provisions.
 Assuming your incentive fee is 20 over 8 and a reasonably successful investment
 program, the catchup will add 1.6% per year to the investment cost; i.e.
 the 20% incentive rate times the 8% hurdle.
 While this would be considered market standard in many contexts, it may
 at times be negotiable.
 The catchup has the biggest impact in the return band of 9% to 12% gross
 returns, where the catchup is paid.
 If this is an interemediate return strategy (as many real estate and credit
 strategies will be) where the expected returns are within that band, you
 need to consider whether this is acceptable to you.
 Negotiated solutions might be elimination of the catchup, possibly in considera
tion for a lower hurdle or the addition of higher incentive structures for
 exceptional performance as in the real estate structure described above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Asset management fees are charged on either 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

committed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

invested
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 capital.
 In the former case you pay a fee on the full amount of capital committed
 whether or not it has been called.
 Assuming investments are made ratably over the first three years of the
 partnership, this adds 1.5 times the annual fee rate over the life of the
 fund.
 Assuming an annual fee rate of 1.5% and weighted average duration of investments
 of eight years, the annual additional cost is a little less then 30bp per
 year.
 This is a fraction of the cost of the catchup, but still important.
 You need to keep in mind the whole picture.
 If your manager is smaller, they may need the early revenue to support
 a proper team for your strategy and you might better serve yourself by
 focusing on other areas for cost savings.
 But compromises may be available in the form of reduced fees on committed
 capital or performance based fees that link fees to achieved operational
 results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, you should pay careful attention to what services are funded by
 the asset management fees and what services are charged as additional fund
 expenses to the partnership or charged to the deals.
 Read the manager's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ADV
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 forms filed with the SEC.
 There is a lot of useful disclosure here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
When Alignment of Interest Fails
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By sharing profits with an asset manager, you achieve alignment of interest
 with them.
 At least while things are going well.
 The system falls apart with underperforming investments.
 With underperforming investments there is no incentive for the manager
 to wrap up the partnership.
 In fact, the manager is better off avoiding asset sales to continue the
 asset management fees and for the option value on the incentive fee in
 case the asset recovers.
 The investor may well prefer to sell and recover their capital from an
 underperforming investment in order to move on to the next thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The situation is exacerbated when incentive fees are paid on a deal by deal
 basis.
 In that case if the manager has sold profitable deals early in the partnership
 and collected incentive fees for them, they may owe the partnership money
 for a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clawback
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on liquidation of the partnership.
 This arises when fees initially advanced for early deals are higher than
 ultimately earned on the partnership as a whole.
 This provides a powerful additional incentive to delay final liquidation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For an investor in a program constructed of traditional closed end fund
 partnership interests there is little defense against these problems other
 than a well diversified portfolio with multiple managers, strategies and
 vintages.
 In that portfolio structure any problems will be mitigated and you can
 gradually weed out any managers who handle tough situations poorly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, if you are a larger investor you may be able to structure investments
 as large 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

separate accounts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on custom terms.
 In those structures, you may be able to negotiate provisions in favor of
 the investor for discretionary termination of investment periods, custom
 mandatory investment criteria and ability to direct liquidation of all
 or part of the assets.
 This approach is much more management intensive and requires specialized
 expertise to implement, but can add significant value in reduced cost and
 reliably aligned interests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One cautionary remark on larger alternate investment structures is that
 just being larger and just reducing fees isn't enough to produce better
 results.
 A number of larger investors have pursued 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

co-invest sidecar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 structures where they get investment allocations side by side with a traditiona
l investment fund at reduced or no fees.
 The criteria for investment allocation vary, but generally larger deals
 are allocated partly to the co-invest vehicles.
 Josh Lerner and Antoinette Schoar analyzed a large database of investments
 in these types of alternate vehicles and concluded that the alternate structure
s underperformed the related fund investments for many investors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lerner2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 If you are going to pursue alternate and larger structures you will need
 to mitigate the risk of increased concentration through an appropriate
 partnership structure with adequate rights to ensure strategy discipline
 and liquidity rights.
 Just pursuing a larger relationship in order to negotiate lower fees may
 not add value.

Information rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An area of ongoing frustration for me has been the quality and timeliness
 of information delivered to investors.
 Investors often receive information which is partial, not consistently
 presented from quarter to quarter and heavily spun by the firm's marketing
 department.
 Investors should have access to real financial statements for each of the
 portfolio investments, prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
 and delivered promptly.
 Additionally, there should be management discussion including a set of
 key performance indicators relevant to the deal and compared to initial
 underwriting expectations.
 With this information, an investor could know if an investment is going
 well.

When I started to write this paper, I thought it was going to be about the
 quantitative methods.
 I've written code which I believe could be a minor, but useful addition
 to the field and made it available on a github repository.
 It quickly dawned on me that this would create the wrong impression, as
 though implementing these quantitative tricks would lead to a successful
 investment program.
 So, I changed the focus to describe the decision process that the quantitative
 methods are serving.

\begin_layout Standard
The most important determinant of investment success are strategy selection
 and investment manager hiring decisions.
 Private markets investing is business investing.
 Viable strategies exist in every industry and may be growth or value oriented.
 It's incumbent on the investor to consider the business propositions carefully
 and assess whether they add value and create strategic advantage in addressing
 a viable market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Manager hiring decisions are key to successfully implementing the strategies
 you have selected.
 You need to assess the fit of the organization to the strategy – the organizati
on needs depth and expertise in the industries, products and managerial
 disciplines needed by the strategy.
 The organization needs to be healthy with a strong and motivated team.
 The PME methods discussed here provide a rigorous way to assess whether
 a manager has in fact added value.
 But that measurement is only useful in support of your assessment that
 an organization is well suited to implement a strategy you have chosen
 to pursue.
 If you flip the order and conclude something like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the PME was good, the strategy and the firm must be good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, you are (in my opinion) making a mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Negotiation of terms matters.
 The best way to think about cost is as a percent of excess return and we
 have presented methods for analyzing and understanding cost.
 Minimization of cost is not the goal.
 Indeed, if you are successful in selecting strategies and management teams
 your absolute cost will be higher because you will pay more in incentive
 fees.
 You need to negotiate fees keeping in mind the big picture – you want to
 encourage and support your partners to build and maintain high quality
 teams and the fees paid need to be consistent with that.
 The mix and timing of fees paid needs to be logical for the firm you have
 chosen as your partner.
 But when the dust settles, you want the fees to bear a reasonable relationship
 to excess returns earned.
 As the investor you are taking essentially all of the risk and need to
 retain a fair share of the reward.

How has this worked out for ASRS? I've consciously said very little about
 my employer.
 But I've worked at ASRS for ten years mostly as Head of Private Markets
 Investing and the last four years as CIO.
 We have built a private markets program consisting of real estate, private
 equity and credit that now amounts to about 40% of our fund and is targeted
 to be about 50% of the fund in coming years.
 Over that ten year period, the private markets investments have exceeded
 their benchmarks with annual excess returns for the ten year period of
 1.7% for private equity, 2.7% for real estate and 5.1% for credit.
 In the most recent year ended June 30, 2019, the excess returns were 7.5%
 for private equity, 3.7% for real estate and 2.3% for credit
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The benchmarks are ODCE for real estate, Russell 2000 for private equity
 and the LSTA leveraged loan index + 250bp for credit.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 ASRS has made extensive use of large separate accounts and some direct
 investments in implementing its real estate and credit program.
 These alternate structures have outperformed commingled fund vehicles and
 provide the additional benefit of much closer market engagement providing
 opportunity for building greater expertise and honing of skills.
 These excess returns have added over $2 billion of value to the ASRS trust
 fund and contributed to the overall performance of ASRS which has placed
 it consistenly among the top quartile of public pension plans.

I'd like to close with some thoughts about research and potential reform.
 In the research area, the quantitative research and introduction of techniques
 (notably PME) is useful.
 But more organizational oriented research would help.
 Are there characteristics of firms (such as growth, sharing of carry, managemen
t of careers) that can be associated with higher likelihood of success?
 On the industry side, the near universality of

 as an incentive structure should be questioned.
 Fund sponsors rightly point out that the 8% hurdle may not be appropriate
 in a 2% treasury world.
 Incentive compensation linked to excess return relative to market indices
 may be an improvement and use of PME methods in measuring excess performance
 appropriate.
 Reform is needed to improve alignment on underperforming funds.
 The languishing of out-of-the-money funds is common and creates the appearance
 they are being exploited for fees.
 Investors need remedies and structures to address this.
 Finally, progress in the quality and timeliness of information delivered
 to investors would be a great boon to them.
